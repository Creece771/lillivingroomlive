    <p>The show derived from a round table conversation, as most great ideas do.The right group of people at the right time and, desire. Musicians, filmmakers, alcohol snobs, and that one guy who won't fold his laundry. </p>
    <p>It's clear where our video documenting inspiration came from. Also fair to assume, if there's a market-fill it! We strive to promote talent closer to home. The community built from three musicians, various Mainers, and students developed a spiderweb network. This network, gives us the ability to pull in different talents, who play solely for the passion, surrounded by an audience ready to groove.    </p>
